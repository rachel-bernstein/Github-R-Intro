```{r}
source("setup.R")
```

```{r}
data("knz_bison")
```


1. Create a new column in the bison dataset that calculates the individualâ€™s age at the time of observation.

```{r}
knz_bison_age <- knz_bison %>%
  mutate(age = (rec_year - animal_yob))
view(knz_bison_age)
```

2. Write a function that will first filter the bison dataset based on any user-specified weight threshold (returning the filtered dataset).

```{r}
weight_filter <- function(x) {
  knz_bison %>%
    filter(animal_weight < x) %>%
    return
}

weight_filter(1000)
```

3. Create a boxplot showing weight distribution between male and female bison, and then conduct a t-test to see if weight is significantly difference between males and females.

```{r}
ggplot(knz_bison, aes(x = animal_sex, y = animal_weight)) +
  geom_boxplot()

knz_bison %>%
t_test(animal_weight ~ animal_sex)
```
